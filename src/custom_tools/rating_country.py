For countries that should be supporting others, or can do it alone, we evaluate the domestic part - what it will do on their own territory - of its (NDC). For countries that could expect to receive support to fully decarbonise, we evaluate the conditional NDC; what a government plans to do if it receives international support. Countries that do not have a conditional NDC are rated using their unconditional NDC and are encouraged to develop a conditional NDC, outlining the support they need. If an NDC doesn't specify that part of the emissions reduction target is to be achieved outside the country's own borders, we assume that the NDC target is domestic only), Fair share target (The CAT rates NDC targets against each country's fair share contribution to global climate change mitigation, considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability, and equality. For assessing targets against the fair share, we consider both a country's domestic emission reductions and any emissions it supports abroad through the use of market mechanisms or other ways of support, as relevant. Here we evaluate what a government has promised to do with its own resources within its own territory or outside against our fair share pathways), Climate finance (A government whose fair share obligations are difficult, or even impossible, to meet with its target on its own territory is expected to meet its fair share internationally through funding and supporting emission reductions in other countries through direct financial resources. We include here only the direct financial transfers; the implied transfers accounted against the reduction target are already covered under the fair share target. For assessing targets against the fair share, we consider both a country's domestic emission reductions and its climate finance rating), Net zero target(We provide an assessment of the comprehensiveness and transparency of governments' net zero targets as part of their complete climate action efforts based on our ten-step good practice evaluation methodology.)",
